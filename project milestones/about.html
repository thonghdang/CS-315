            <p> This is a simple website that I build for my CS 315 project Milestone to learn and practice my skill with HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, etc. In this project, I want to make an e-commerce website that will sell some products (probably is some of the handmade stuff or t-shirt). User have an option to add the goods to cart (which I will implement later) but they won't be able to check out (I will if I dive into more advance stuff).</p>
            
            <p> I might consider adding more features for my website, such as making a Q and A tab, which allow user to ask question and see the answer.</p>
